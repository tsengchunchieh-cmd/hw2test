# Linear Regression CRISP-DM Project Summary

This document summarizes a Streamlit-based project demonstrating linear regression using synthetic data, following the CRISP-DM methodology.

## Core Project Summary (CRISP-DM Steps)

The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology, broken down into these key steps:

1.  **Business Understanding:** Clearly define the purpose and objectives of the linear regression model.
2.  **Data Understanding:** Generate synthetic data (y = ax + b + noise) to simulate real-world scenarios.
3.  **Data Preparation:** Prepare and format the generated data arrays for input into the linear regression model.
4.  **Modeling:** Implement and fit a LinearRegression model to the prepared data.
5.  **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance by computing key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
6.  **Deployment:** Develop an interactive Streamlit application to showcase the model and its results.

## Development Log Summary

Key development activities included:

*   Setting up the Python environment and installing necessary dependencies.
*   Implementing interactive sliders for adjusting model parameters like slope, intercept, noise level, and the number of data points.
*   Building the core linear regression functionality using the `sklearn` library.
*   Integrating and displaying performance metrics and data visualizations within the Streamlit application.

## Specification Summary

The project's specifications include:

*   **User-Adjustable Parameters:** Slope (a), intercept (b), noise level, and number of data points.
*   **Model:** Utilizes `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`.
*   **Metrics:** Evaluates performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
*   **Visualization:** Provides a scatter plot with a superimposed regression line.
*   **Deployment:** An interactive Streamlit application.

## Test Plan Summary

The testing strategy involves:

1.  **Data Generation Test:** Generate 50 data points with predefined parameters (slope=2, intercept=5, noise=1) and verify that the output ranges are correct.
2.  **Regression Fit Test:** Confirm that the fitted regression model yields a slope approximately equal to 2 and an intercept approximately equal to 5.
3.  **Performance Metric Test:** Ensure that the R² value is greater than or equal to 0.9 and that the MSE is within reasonable bounds.
4.  **Plot Rendering Test:** Verify that the scatter plot and regression line are displayed correctly.
5.  **Interactivity Test:** Confirm that adjusting the sliders in the Streamlit app dynamically updates the displayed results and visualizations.

## Streamlit App Code (app.py) Overview

The `app.py` code leverages `streamlit`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`, `sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error`, `sklearn.metrics.r2_score`, and `matplotlib.pyplot`.

The application features:

*   A main title: "Simple Linear Regression Explorer - CRISP-DM Example".
*   Section headers for "Business Understanding", "Data Generation Parameters", "Data Understanding & Preparation", "Modeling", "Evaluation", and "Visualization".
*   Interactive sliders for "Slope (a)", "Intercept (b)", "Noise level", and "Number of points".
*   Displays the learned slope and intercept, Mean Squared Error, and R2 Score.
*   Visualizes the data with a scatter plot and the calculated regression line.

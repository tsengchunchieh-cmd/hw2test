To send the project to GitHub and deploy to Streamlit, I need the following information:

**For GitHub:**
1.  **GitHub Repository URL:** The URL of the repository where you want to push the code.
2.  **GitHub Credentials:** Your GitHub username and a Personal Access Token (PAT) with appropriate permissions (or other authentication method).
3.  **Branch Name:** The name of the branch you want to push to (e.g., `main`, `master`, `development`).
4.  **Git Initialization:** If this is not already a Git repository, I would need to initialize it, add files, and commit them.

**For Streamlit Deployment:**
1.  **Deployment Method:** Are you using Streamlit Cloud, a custom server, or another method?
2.  **Streamlit App Entry Point:** The path to the main Python file that runs your Streamlit application (e.g., `app.py`).
3.  **Streamlit Cloud Connection (if applicable):** If using Streamlit Cloud, it typically connects directly to a GitHub repository. I would need to know if this is the intended method and if the repository will be public or private.
